# FriendFinder
Heroku and Express Assignment

* Hello! This app uses express() to create a live server, .get and .post functions to post onto the website and pull information from the .node JSON database. API routes are used to navigate between web pages and AJAX calls are used to communicate between the array of friends and website. 

How to Use:
1. Click the button on the bottom of the home page. 
2. On the survey page, give a name for the entry.
3. Then find a url link to an image online, make sure it ends with a .jpg, .png, or another image file format. 
4. Read the questions and choose your answers between 1-5.
5. When done, click Submit at the bottom of a page. 
6. A friend with the closest match to your score will appear on your screen. 
7. Hooray! You made a new freind. The more survey respondents, the more possible matches there are to choose from. 

* There is an array of objects with some Friends already. Your response is added to the array. Your closest friend is displayed on the screen by adding up all of the submitted answers and displaying the friend with the nearest absolute value.
